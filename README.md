SHOPPING SITE


An e-commerce site is a platform that facilitates online transactions between buyers and sellers, enabling them to exchange goods and services over the internet. By leveraging Django, a powerful Python-based web framework, we can develop a robust and scalable e-commerce application that caters to both customers and sellers. This project will adopt a function-based approach, offering distinct functionalities for each user type through separate customer and seller applications.

Overview
The e-commerce site will consist of two primary roles:

Customer:

Customers can browse products, view product details, add items to their cart, and make purchases.
Each customer will have an account to track their orders, manage their profile, and view purchase history.
Ordered details and payment details are passed into user's personal mail 
Seller:

Sellers can manage their product listings, including adding new products, updating product information, and removing items.
Sellers will have an account to track their sales, manage inventory, and view sales analytics.
