SHOPPING SITE

This project deals with developing a Virtual website ‘E-commerce Website’. It provides the user with a list of the various products available for purchase in the store. For the convenience of online shopping, a shopping cart is provided to the user. After the selection of the goods, it is sent for the order confirmation process. The system is implemented using Python’s web framework Django
It will display products, and customers can select catalogs and select products and can remove products from their cart specifying the quantity of each item. Selected items will be collected in a cart. At checkout, the item on the card will be presented as an order. Customers can pay for the items in the cart to complete an order. This project has a great future scope. The project also provides security with the use of login ID and passwords, so that no unauthorized users can access your account. The only authorized person who has the appropriate access authority can access the software.
